# energized_id_web

A web app that uses [AngularDart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular) and
[AngularDart Components](https://webdev.dartlang.org/components).

Created from templates made available by Stagehand under a BSD-style
[license](https://github.com/dart-lang/stagehand/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Help! It doesn't compile :(

Several people working on this project believe that open-sourcing the ID templates used at Energy Institute High School would be a potential security risk. We have therefore elected not to check the template (HTML) or style (SCSS) files for the IdPreviewComponent into source control. Let the bad actors spend their own hour-and-a-half recreating it, that's how long it took me...

If you need the template files to do actual work on this project, contact @quantumAssembly ~~TODO: give Micah the templates and direct inquiries his way~~ to be provided with the templates or functional equivalents. For the sake of reference, the missing files are:

```
lib/src/components/id_preview_component/id_preview_component.html
lib/src/components/id_preview_component/id_preview_component.scss
```
